# Misc Directory

This directory contains experimental, deprecated, or archived code that is not part of the main package.

## Contents

### Archived/Removed Functions

- **TopoCBN.R** - Topological clustering function using Betti numbers. This function was removed from the package in version 8.2 due to removal of the `TDA` package dependency. The implementation is preserved here for reference.

### Old Versions

- **causality_predVAR_v0.R** - Previous version of the `causality_predVAR()` function, retained for reference during development.

## Recommendations

- **TopoCBN.R** - Keep for archival purposes since it was a documented feature removed for dependency reasons. Users may still want to access it.

- **causality_predVAR_v0.R** - Can be removed once the new version is stable and well-tested.
